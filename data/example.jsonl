Instructions\nBased on the provided stock information, rate the company using the scale above and the following guidelines:\n - Be skeptical of statements in the earnings transcript due to insider bias. But product announcements, analyst questions, sentiment clues, and insights into the company's strategy are valuable.\n - Analyst ratings and price targets are important signals but should not be considered definitive, especially if the data is sparse or non-existent.\n - Positive indicators include early signs of a turnaround, a company recently becoming profitable, a deepening moat, insider buying, or market sentiment turning positive.\n - Early signs of slowing growth, unsustainable pricing power, reduced profitability, or declining competitive advantages are negative.\n - Valuation is crucial - aim to buy great companies at reasonable prices.\n", "output": "{\"entity\": \"BSRR\", \"rating\": 1.0, \"returns_wavg\": -0.18, \"returns_365d\": -0.19, \"returns_180d\": -0.17, \"returns_90d\": -0.2, \"returns_30d\": -0.03}"}

the provided stock information, rate the company using the scale above and the following guidelines:\n - Be skeptical of statements in the earnings transcript due to insider bias. But product announcements, analyst questions, sentiment clues, and insights into the company's strategy are valuable.\n - Analyst ratings and price targets are important signals but should not be considered definitive, especially if the data is sparse or non-existent.\n - Positive indicators include early signs of a turnaround, a company recently becoming profitable, a deepening moat, insider buying, or market sentiment turning positive.\n - Early signs of slowing growth, unsustainable pricing power, reduced profitability, or declining competitive advantages are negative.\n - Valuation is crucial - aim to buy great companies at reasonable prices.\n", "output": "{\"entity\": \"CASS\", \"rating\": 1.0, \"returns_wavg\": -0.05, \"returns_365d\": -0.04, \"returns_180d\": -0.07, \"returns_90d\": -0.1, \"returns_30d\": -0.04}"}
